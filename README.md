Minecraft Backup Scripts
========================
- The script `syncminecraft.py` is the only script you need to remember.
- This required you to install rclone.
- To tailor this for you, edit the python file and replace the home directory with your home directory and then edit all the files to replace the rclone remote location for your remote location.
